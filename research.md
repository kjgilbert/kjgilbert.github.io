My research focuses on the impact complex demographic histories have on evolutionary processes 
through time and space. The interactions of mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and selection 
can be greatly altered in non-equilibrium scenarios. Most recently I have addressed these 
questions by studying local adaptation during range expansions. I have previously investigated 
the accuracy of methods for estimating effective population size in the presence of migration. 
During my current post-doc at the University of Toronto, I am conducting another methods-testing 
study to investigate the bias introduced by various mating systems in estimating the distribution 
of fitness effects for new mutations.

I generally aim to address my research questions through both theoretical simulation-based 
approaches, as well as with validation and testing with empirical data. My future work will 
involve comparing several range expansion models to real-world genomic data from humans and 
other species.

I maintain an active interest in the role of data accessibility and archiving in 
scientific research and in scientific reproducibility, which I have worked on with the 
[UBC reproducibility group](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~repro/UBC_Reproducibility_Group/Welcome.html).

My undergraduate research involved examining the effects of biological invasions on genetic 
diversity and population structure, and using this information combined with approximate 
Bayesian computation to describe the history of an invasion of the plant *Silene latifolia*.


Please see my [CV](https://github.com/kjgilbert/kjgilbert.github.io/raw/master/pdfs/KGilbert_CV.pdf) 
and [publications](http://kjgilbert.github.io/publications/) for further information.

#### Other Projects and Collaborations

I maintain an active interest in many other facets of science, biology, and population 
genetics which I enjoy exploring with collaborators.

Several current projects include:

- The role of data accessibility and archiving in scientific research and reproducibility 
with the [UBC reproducibility group](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~repro/UBC_Reproducibility_Group/Welcome.html)

-  The role of landscape and demography in spatial genetic structure before and after a 
population crash in an alpine butterfly species, as part of a 2012 distributed graduate 
seminar and mini-course on landscape genetics

- Application of methods for estimating effective population size within a hierarchically 
structured metapopulation of *Silene latifolia*

- Genetic analysis of metapopulation processes in the *Silene-Microbotryum* host-pathogen 
system.
