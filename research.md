Currently as a data scientist in clinical trials research, I develop R packages and shiny apps for interactive work in clinical data. I build and maintain databases in REDCap and SecuTrial, and enjoy all the fun aspects of data wrangling and data analysis and presentation.

My previous research focused on the impact complex demographic histories have on evolutionary processes 
through time and space. The interactions of mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and selection 
can be greatly altered in non-equilibrium scenarios. I studied these processes through a 
combination of theoretical and empirical approaches to inform our understanding of local adaptation, 
mutation load, evolution of recombination modifiers, and the distribution of fitness effects for 
new mutations (DFE).

A portion of my research was devoted to methods testing and development where I worked on methods for *Q<sub>ST</sub>*-*F<sub>ST</sub>* comparisons and investigated the biases associated with evolutionary inference approaches through analysis of simulated data, 
including inference of the DFE and estimation of effective population size.

I maintain an active interest in the role of data accessibility and archiving in 
scientific research and in scientific reproducibility, which I have worked on with the 
[UBC reproducibility group](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~repro/UBC_Reproducibility_Group/Welcome.html).

My undergraduate research involved examining the effects of biological invasions on genetic 
diversity and population structure, and using this information combined with approximate 
Bayesian computation to describe the history of invasion of the plant *Silene latifolia*.


Please see my [CV](https://github.com/kjgilbert/kjgilbert.github.io/raw/master/pdfs/KGilbert_CV.pdf) 
and [publications](http://kjgilbert.github.io/publications/) for further information.

#### Other Projects and Collaborations

I maintain an active interest in many other facets of science, biology, and population 
genetics which I enjoyed exploring with collaborators.

Several side projects included:

- The role of data accessibility and archiving in scientific research and reproducibility 
with the [UBC reproducibility group](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~repro/UBC_Reproducibility_Group/Welcome.html)

-  The role of landscape and demography in spatial genetic structure before and after a 
population crash in an alpine butterfly species, as part of a 2012 distributed graduate 
seminar and mini-course on landscape genetics

- Application of methods for estimating effective population size within a hierarchically 
structured metapopulation of *Silene latifolia*

- Genetic analysis of metapopulation processes in the *Silene-Microbotryum* host-pathogen 
system.
