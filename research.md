At the broadest level, my interests are in gene flow and its effects on genetic population 
structure, local adaptation, and evolution in time and space. I am exploring the role of 
environmental heterogeneity and varying population sizes in these interactions and the 
implications this has for persistence and differentiation of populations into the future.

My current research has both an empirical and theoretical focus. I am examining the genetic 
basis of local adaptation in *Pinus contorta* (lodgepole pine), conducting a study to validate 
methods for detecting SNPs (GWAS, *Fst* outlier tests, environment-allele correlations) which 
confer adaptation to certain environmental conditions . I am also investigating through 
simulations how local adaptation can vary across a species range, especially at range edges.

I have a strong interest in the adequacy of methods and models used to infer results from 
empirical population genetic data. I am currently evaluating a range of methods used for 
estimating effective population size.

My past work has involved examining the effects of biological invasions on genetic diversity 
and population structuring, and using this information combined with approximate Bayesian 
computation to unravel the history of an invasion of the plant *Silene latifolia*.

#### Other Projects and Collaborations

I maintain an active interest in many other facets of science, biology, and population 
genetics which I enjoy exploring with collaborators.

Several current projects include:

- The role of data accessibility and archiving in scientific research and reproducibility 
with the UBC reproducibility group

-  The role of landscape and demography in spatial genetic structure before and after a 
population crash in an alpine butterfly species, as part of a 2012 distributed graduate 
seminar and mini-course on landscape genetics

- Application of methods for estimating effective population size within a hierarchically 
structured metapopulation of *Silene latifolia*

- Genetic analysis of metapopulation processes in the *Silene-Microbotryum* host-pathogen 
system.
